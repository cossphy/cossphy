*Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Solid-State Physics*

The computational study and analysis of a real problem in solid-state physics, the implementation of computational methods for the research and prediction of physical phenomena or the behavior of physical systems is an extension of theoretical science based mainly on physical, mathematical and computational methods.

It can be used to explore new theories and to model and simulate new experiments. It is an alternative when the phenomena are not easy to observe or when the experimental measurements are impractical, time consuming or costly.

In recent years with the exponential increase of computing power, computational simulation has emerged as a powerful tool that has revolutionized the research field of solid-state physics and beyond. The use of simulations and computer models is pervasive in all areas of solid-state science and at every stage of a researcher's life cycle.

In addition, computational materials physics in the Department of Physics over the last decade is undoubtedly a field of excellence with a number of courses taught both at the undergraduate level and in the two major postgraduate courses "Materials Physics & Technology" and "Computational Physics". Several related high impact factor publications have been published in recent years.

The laboratory aims at the development of activity and / or the connection with fields of education, of society, of administration, of economy related to the fields of interest of the laboratory.

Laboratories of Theoretical and Computational Solid-State Physics are among the fastest growing laboratories in the last two decades worldwide.

Computer simulations take us closer to a new era. It is the key to progress in the field of science, having over the last decade a solid impact on all its sub-sectors. Computational simulations have grown rapidly as a tool in recent years as mathematical modeling, computational algorithms, computing speed, Big Data era and the computing infrastructures have also greatly developed. High Performance Computing (HPC) -based simulations have a huge impact on industry and research worldwide.
